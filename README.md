Thunderpuff
-----------

Thunderpuff is an entirely experimental CloudFormation configuration generator
written in python.

Goals:

* Ingest existing configurations and produce something reasonable.
* Make it easy to reuse code.
* Don't be too magic. Just the right amount of magic.
* Easy UI for creating/updating/destroying stacks and managing secrets.
  (Possibly Vault integration?)

Look at your own risk. Consume in small doses to prevent fatal allergic reactions.
